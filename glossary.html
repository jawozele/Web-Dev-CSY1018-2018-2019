      <!-- Page content for Glossary page --> 
      <h2>Agile</h2>
      <p>The term refers to an iterative, incremental method of managing design and development. Requirements are deemed to evolve from sprint to sprint and teams work in collaboration to achieve a common goal.</p>
      <h2>API</h2>
      <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a mechanism that enables various systems to communicate. It provides a foundation for accessing or manipulating data from a system., usually provided by the system’s implementors.</p>
      <h2>Back-end Development</h2>
      <p>Back-end Developers obtain prototypes and script all the code that makes them fully functional and populated the the required and relevant data</p>
      <h2>CMS</h2>
      <p>A Content Management System allows the access of stored information. In the case of a small business, an internal site can be created to showcase how to perform various technical tasks.</p>
      <h2>CRM</h2>
      <p>A CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system is a tool used to store and retrieve customer information.Typically, it can store customer information such as name, age, address and date of birth.</p>
      <h2>Discovery</h2>
      <p>Discovery is a dedicated period where teams are committed to developing an in-depth understanding of of a client and how they operate on a daily basis. This provides the team with an overview of how the business functions in a timely fashion</p>
      <h2>Front End Development</h2>
      <p>Front-end developers write the code that controls how a website looks and interacts when it's displayed in a browser. The primary tools of a front-end developer include HTML (code that makes content render on a page), CSS (coded stylesheets that apply color, typography, style and layout to the HTML) and JavaScript (code that handles advanced interactivity). </p>
      <h2>Inbound Marketing</h2>
      <p>
         Inbound marketing is a philosophy for attracting customers and growing your target audience through the production and sharing of useful, relevant information. Blogging, producing videos, and publishing eBooks are all examples of inbound marketing. This is to be contrasted with traditional outbound marketing techniques like email blasting, cold calling, and business self-promotion.
      </p>
      <h2>Marketing Automation</h2>
      <p>
         Marketing Automation Platforms (MAPs) are systems that help businesses automate interactions with current and prospective customers, usually with the end goal of being able to generate, track, and convert business leads. Marketing automation platforms are used to collect and manage information about your customers, send and manage email campaigns, and monitor website behavior and usage—often surrounding inbound marketing campaigns. Popular Marketing Automation platforms include: Hubspot, Marketo, Pardot, and Eloqua.
      </p>
      <h2>Prototypes</h2>
      <p>
         A prototype is a proof of concept used to evaluate a design idea. For example, rather than creating a static mock up of what a web page will look like and then asking stakeholders to "approve the design", a team might create a prototype that everyone can interact within the browser. This gives everyone a more realistic, interactive facsimile of the website to try out. Prototypes help teams test ideas and make necessary changes early on—before committing the effort, time and cost that go into building a fully functional product.
      <h2> QA/QC</h2>
      <p>
         In the course of design and development, somebody needs to review all the work produced, verify that everything is built to spec, and ensure that there are no defects. This is the role of the Quality Assurance and Quality Control engineer. QA (Quality Assurance) refers to the process and standards that exist throughout the software development life-cycle. QC (Quality Control) refers to the action of performing tests to ensure quality at specific points during the production process.
      </p>
      <h2>Quantitative Research and Data</h2>
      <p>
         Quantitative data refers to any aggregated, measurable pieces of information. Typically, it refers to data (analytics) that reflects website/application traffic and usage. On its own, quantifiable data will provide information about what is happening on your website, but not why it's happening. Being able to quantify what's happening (or not happening) on your website can help you determine the best place to focus your UX research, design and development efforts.
      </p>
      <h2>Qualitative Research and Data</h2>
      <p>Qualitative data is information gained through direct observation or interviews with the people who use a product or system. Usability testing is a form of user research that generates qualitative insights.</p>
      <h2>Roadmap</h2>
      <p>A roadmap is a living document that paints out planned strategic activities across a stretch of time. Roadmaps are used to help teams and stakeholders visualize the timeline of moving pieces that need to be aligned as part of big initiatives. </p>
      <h2>Sprints</h2>
      <p>A sprint is the determinate window of time a team has to successfully complete a chunk of work. Sprints are used to deliver design work, deploy code, and ship new features incrementally. </p>
      <h2>UAT</h2>
      <p> The user in UAT refers to the client stakeholder team responsible for providing final sign off and approval that features are working as expected, prior to pushing them live.</p>
      <h2>UI Design</h2>
      <p>UI (User Interface) Design is the design of how things on screen look. Color, layout, typography, style, and animation effects all exist within the domain of UI design. UI designers will have a solid understanding of the principles of graphic design and website usability. </p>
      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>Usability testing involves sitting down with a user of a website, product, or application and observing what they do. This can be done in person, or remotely via screen share. A typical usability testing session combines a general interview with guided and unguided walkthroughs of the interface being tested. </p>
      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>Any of a toolbox of techniques used to gather insights about people, their motivations, and their behavioral patterns—specifically as they pertain to interactions with products, websites or applications. User research can include a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques.</p>
      <h2>UX</h2>
      <p>UX stands for user experience. User experience, as a discipline, is the application of design tools and techniques to uncover user goals and needs. This all works toward the goal of crafting products, applications, and systems that are useful, desirable, and easy for people to use. </p>
      <h2>Waterfall</h2>
      <p>Waterfall is a detailed project workflow where each step in the process happens in a sequence. The steps are outlined as planning, design, testing, then deployment.</p>
